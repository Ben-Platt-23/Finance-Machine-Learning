        Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax

        to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

Mon Aug 18 05:58:19 MDT 2025: Training started with PID: 19730
Training is now running in the background!
You can safely close this terminal and go to sleep.

To monitor progress:
  tail -f autonomous_training_output.log

To check if it's still running:
  ps aux | grep 19730

Log files will be created in:
  - autonomous_training.log (detailed training log)
  - autonomous_training_output.log (script output)
  - overnight_training_20250818_055732.log (setup log)

Models will be saved in: trained_models/

ðŸŒ™ GOOD NIGHT! Your models will be ready in the morning! ðŸŒ™
Mon Aug 18 05:58:24 MDT 2025: Setup complete. Training is running autonomously.
